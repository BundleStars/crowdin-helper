# crowdin-helper

Unofficial addition to Crowdin CLI to automate continuous integration workflow.

This is an initial, prototype version, which we experiment with to use in our team's workflow. For now some things are harcoded inside, accordingly to our own needs. You're welcome to use it as a source of inspiration, fork it and modify code to make it usable in your projects. We would appreciate any kind of feedback, suggestions, pull requests.
